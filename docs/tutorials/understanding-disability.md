# Understanding disability
Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. 
We cannot guarantee that our pages will be accessible to everyone without understanding:
* Why people experience problems using websites.
* What kind of difficulty they are experiencing.
* What support technologies do they use, to cope with them, to meet the challenges.

## Types of user capabilities
People's capabilities can be broken down into various categories, of which the following four are particularly relevant, for website interaction.

## Vision capabilities

Vision is the ability to use the colour and brightness of light to perceive objects, distinguish them, and detect them. People have different vision problems. In general, we can distinguish three groups:
* Blindness - inability to see visual information
* Low vision - loss of central or peripheral vision, blurred vision, generalized haze, extreme light sensitivity - significant visual impairment that can't be corrected fully with glasses, contact lenses, medication or eye surgery
* Color deficiency
  * Deuteranopia – red-green color blindness
  * Protanopia – red color blindness  
  * Tritanopia – blue-yellow color blindness
  * Achromatopsia - total color blindness

Blindness and low vision can occur as a result of various illnesses, conditions or accidents. Some eye defects are inherited, others acquired. Loss or impairment of vision can occur in people of all ages, but most often occurs in persons over 65 years of age.

People who are blind usually navigate, using only the keyboard and use screen readers, braille displays, voice input.

People with low vision can use the screen magnifiers and assistance from the screen reader.

People who have color disabilities may need the right colors and more contrast and alternative ways of identifying color content. 

## Motor and dexterity capabilities

Web browsing requires a keyboard and pointing device. These tasks require the skill and dexterity of the hands and shoulders. Many people have different difficulties with manipulating their hands. These difficulties include:
 
* Amputation of limbs or fingers or other parts of the human body
* Arthritis - inflammation, degeneration, or damage to the joints
* Fibromyalgia - the chronic pain of muscle and connective tissues
* Rheumatism
* Parkinson's disease
* Muscular dystrophy
* Repetitive stress injury (RSI)
* Tremor and spasms
* Spinal cord injuries
* Cerebral palsy
* Carpal tunnel syndrome
* Reduced dexterity

People with dexterity disabilities may have little or no motor control in their hands to perform everyday tasks.
Many can continue to operate the computer with one hand, one foot, eyes, a headpointer or a mouth stick or other assistive technologies such as adaptive keyboards, switches, sip and puff, etc.

## Hearing

The hearing is the ability to differentiate specific tones or speech from ambient noise and orientation, where sounds come from.
Hearing disorders include:

* Deafness - substantial, uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears.
* Hard of hearing - mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears.
* Deaf-blindness - substantial, uncorrectable hearing and visual impairments.

Deaf and hearing impaired people need sound alternatives - transcripts, captions and information, in clear, comprehensible language.

## Intellectual capabilities

There are many types of intellectual disability that limit the ability to perceive, recognize, understand, interpret or respond to information.

**Learning difficulties**
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted.
* Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
* Perceptual disabilities - dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia or spatial and temporal orientation
* Low comprehension (having problems understanding content, textual or otherwise)
* Low reading abilities (having problems reading text)
* Other non-verbal learning difficulties

**Cognitive disabilities**
* Loss of brain function
* Limited short-term memory
* Missing long-term memory
* Limited ability to recall language
* Alzheimer's disease
* Parkinson's disease
* Multiple sclerosis 

**Neurological disabilities**
* Seizure disorders - includes different types of epilepsy and migraines
* Anxiety 
* Depression
* Schizophrenia
* many other disorders.

This group of people uses such assistive technologies as word prediction aids and reading/writing comprehension aids.

## Statistics disability
Here are some statistics showing the disability problem.
* Over a billion people, about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability.
* Between 110 million and 190 million adults have significant difficulties in functioning.
* Rates of disability are increasing due to population ageing and increases in chronic health conditions, among other causes.
* Between 250 million and 500 million people worldwide suffer a spinal cord injury.
* 300 million people worldwide are affected by depression
* 47 million people worldwide have dementia

The table below shows the percentage of different types of disability on the example of USA. 
As we can see the largest group of disability is learning disability. It affects nearly half of USA population. 
The next one is motor impairment – strightly connected with only-keyboard users.

| Disability types | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| Learning disabilities | 45.7%
| Motor impairments | 13.9%
| Health impairments | 11.6%
| Mental illness | 7.8% |
| Hearing impairments | 5.6% | 
| Visually impairments | 4.4% |
| Speech impairments | 0.9% |
